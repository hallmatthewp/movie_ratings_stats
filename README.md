# Node.js learning exercise

## Implement a Movie rating aggregation service
Your challenge is to implement an aggregation service that will receive a continuous supply of 
movie ratings. Your service should be able to provide several statistics on each movie that was 
rated as well as for the aggregation service as a whole.
 
### Objectives
Your submission should satisfy the following:

* Connect to the provided streaming server
* Listen and aggregate rating submissions
* Provide an interface to retrieve statistics about the ratings and the service
    * This can be done via a web page, command line or any other mechanism you'd like to create

Statistics to provide:

* Count of all ratings received
* Average rating for each Movie
* Total number of ratings per Movie
* Average ratings per second

Extra credit:

* Use all available CPU cores to aggregate more rating data
* Provide real-time updates to your chosen interface

## 3rd-party Code
   
Use your discretion. We’re trying to assess your architecture expertise, not the framework 
author’s. Some libraries will help you with busywork, but larger frameworks will rob you of 
opportunities to show off your chops.

Be clear about what code is and isn’t yours.

## Submission
  
Submit an archive containing your source code, with instructions for running it. Please 
provide your submission at least 24 hours in advance of the interview.
