Steps to run Ratings Reader
---------------------------
1) Decrypt the private key file (google-oauth.pem.des3) inside of ./crypt to a 
   file named google-oauth.pem w/ the following command:
   'openssl des3 -d -in google-oauth.pem.des3 -out google-oauth.pem'
   NOTE: This requires a secret passphrase that Matthew Hall will supply at demo 
   time. If you do not decrypt the private key file, Google Drive Sheets updates 
   will not occur.

2) Execute 'node ./streamingServer.js'

3) Execute 'node ./ratingsReader.js'

4) Point browser to: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18pigTsw6OW7Vv3unFI-J7GFn-m45O2caxQk_bN7nkys/edit#gid=0

Additional Options

There are a handful of configuration variables at the top of ratingsReader.js which modify the behavior of the Ratings Reader

TIME_INTERVAL (number): Display refresh rate in seconds

LOG_TO_CONSOLE (boolean): Log to console or not

PUSH_TO_SHEET (boolean): Update Google Drive Sheet or not

USE_SET_INTERVAL (boolean): 'true' causes display refresh samples to occur via a non-blocking call to setInterval. 'false' causes display refresh samples to occur only during JSON payload reads.

HIGH_PRECISION_MODE (boolean): Determines whether floating point numbers will be rounded to nearest half or not.
